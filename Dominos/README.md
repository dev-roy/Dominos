#  Test Driven Development

### Definition 

Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.

### Why TDD?

It is a way of writing software that minimizes the chances of bugs and unexpected behaviours creeping in. Developing this way also results in small easy to change components.

### Scenario

Dominos has hired you to build the iOS app for its business. Like the wise developer that you are you encourage Dominos to start small and iterate quickly. Therefore, you decide to start with a digital menu for the customers.
